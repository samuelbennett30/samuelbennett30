## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
I am an automotive embedded engineer with **3.6+ years of industry experience** at a Tier-1 supplier, working on **production Body Control Modules (BCM)**.

My background spans **system-level validation, ECU diagnostics (UDS), CAN/LIN communication, and CI-driven automation**. I am currently transitioning deeper into **embedded firmware and platform-level roles**, strengthening my expertise in **Embedded C, RTOS, and Embedded Linux**, while leveraging real-world production experience.

I focus on building **robust, debuggable, and production-ready embedded systems** — not demo-only code. <br>
🌱   Learning more about Automation, Systems Design and Artificial Intelligence.

## 🌱 Repositories (Work in Progress)

This GitHub documents my **hands-on transition into embedded firmware and platform validation**.

- **embedded-portfolio**  
  Embedded C exercises, RTOS labs, Linux fundamentals, and protocol-level tools.

Each repository emphasizes:
- Clear problem statements  
- Build / run instructions  
- Design reasoning  
- Engineering trade-offs and learnings  

---

## Engineering Philosophy
- Prefer **clarity over cleverness** in embedded code
- Design systems with **debugging and validation in mind**
- Treat failures as **system-level signals**, not isolated bugs
- Optimize for **maintainability and observability**

---

## Career Focus
I am interested in roles involving:
- Embedded / Firmware Development
- Platform or SoC Validation
- Embedded Systems Engineering
- Automotive Embedded Software

Especially positions where **hardware, firmware, and validation intersect**.

---

## Currently Learning
- FreeRTOS internals and real-time design patterns
- Embedded Linux boot flow and driver fundamentals
- Low-level debugging workflows
